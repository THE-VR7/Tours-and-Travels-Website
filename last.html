    <h1 id="RP" style="text-align: center;">Refund Policy</h1>
    <hr>

    <p>Privacy is considered as one of the fundamental human rights by many countries in the world. The governments of these countries have passed legislation to protect individuals from their personal data being collected, distributed and used for numerous purposes without their knowledge.<br>

            Unlike other legal documents that people and companies display on their websites, the privacy policy is the only one that is required by law. The law strictly regulates the practice of displaying the privacy policy on websites or apps. We will come back to this in the privacy policy law requirements section of this article.<br>
            
            The definition of a privacy policy is easy to understand: "A privacy policy is a form of agreement. It is required by law if you use and/or collect any website (application user) personal data. The single purpose of this agreement is to inform website visitors about your data collection and sharing practices."<br>
            
            Simply put, it is a document that describes in detail what personal information your website collects from its visitors along with how you store it and use it.
            
            Here is what falls into the category of personal data:</p>

    <p>
            Besides this, you will have to get familiar with such laws and acts of the state you reside in.<br><br> For instance, the State of California has the Business and Professions Code in power. This one requires any operator of an online service or commercial website owner who collects and stores personal information of residents of California to have and display a privacy policy agreement on the website.<br><br>

            In the end, make sure to check if there are any extensive legal requirements of having Privacy Policies, depending on your business model and the industry you are in.
